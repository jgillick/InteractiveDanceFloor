# Interactive LED Dance Floor

The goal is to create a touch reactive LED dance floor that is easy to setup, teardown and transport.

Follow the development on my [Hackaday project page](https://hackaday.io/project/189052-next-gen-interactive-dance-floor).

This is the successor to the original [Interactive Disco Dance Floor](https://github.com/jgillick/DiscoDanceFloorV1)

# Navigation

This monorepo is broken up into these areas:

- Hardware - KiCad and Fusion360 files for the circuit boards and physical structure.
- Host - The host software that controls the individual dance floor tiles.
- Firmware - The LED & touch sensor firmware running inside each dance floor tile and communicating with the host.
